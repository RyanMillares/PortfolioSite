                <p>My name is Ryan Millares. I'm currently a 4th year student at Chapman University studying Computer Science and Data Analytics, with a
                    minor in Game Development Programming. I currently work as a project lead and undergraduate research assistant at the 
                Institute for Interdisciplinary and Brain Behavioral Sciences. On the side, I enjoy playing chess, indie game dev, and practicing 2D 
            art. While I am in school, I am looking for part-time internships in software engineering or data analytics, and aim at landing a full-time 
        career in data science after graduating. </p>
